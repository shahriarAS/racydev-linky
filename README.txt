The most effective link monetized wp plugin. Put ad as much as you want, set a timer before the link is revealed. Generate revenue more than anytime.

== Description ==

Sometimes we feel that our website is not making money enough from advertising. Because most of the users do not watch your ad enough or do not spend much time. To fix this problem and generate more revenue you have to tie your visitors to your website.

That is why we built this awesome plugin that will help you to tie your visitors within your web page. You have to just create a WordPress page and put your ad on that page. Then set a shortcode from our plugin on your page. And then you don't have to worry about your page.

After that, you will just make any type of post you like and put your link in that post with our shortcode. And rest of the thing will handle our advanced plugin. Whenever a user or visitor clicks the link to your post it will redirect them to the special page which you have created at first full of ads.

There a timer will show up and visitors have to wait for a certain time and after the finish, the timer original download link will reveal. Then the user can go to the original link.

Because of high security, no one can get the original URL without waiting for the timer to finish. In this way, you can generate more revenue from your ad and make your visit more engaged with your website.

**How to use?**

**Step-1:** At first create a WordPress page and put an ad or any type of content you like.

**Step-7:** In the above shortcode change the **title** text to anything you like to put in your button text.

**Step-8:** Change the **link** to your **original link** where the user will be passed through the middle ad+timer page.
